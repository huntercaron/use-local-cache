# useLocalCache

React hooks for using local storage as a cache.
Intended for use in Framer X. 

## API Usage



## Installation 
`yarn add use-local-cache`

## Usage
`use`

## Thanks
Thanks Henrique Gusso & Koen Bok for the idea and Patrick Burtchaell for  advising.

Inspired from [this fb thread](https://www.facebook.com/groups/framerjs/permalink/1932464396880622/)


To-do: 
- useImageCache(arrOfImages)
- write tests

> *Disclamer: This was created for prototyping in Framer X, and is most likely not suited for use on the web :)*
